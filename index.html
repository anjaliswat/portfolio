        <h3>Collaborate For Africa</h3>

        <div class="description">
          Created a website for an NGO called Collaborate For Africa with a team of 3 people. The website was created using the
  MEAN stack. The application allows users to add stories, research papers and events they are hosting. The rich text editor TinyMCE has been integrated in the website to allow users to style their content. Authorization has been provided using Auth0. A whitelist has been created that currently gives only members of the organization access to add and delete content on the website.

        <h3>Weather App</h3>

        <div class="description">
        Created a weather app using Google's and Dark Skyâ€™s API. In this app users can enter a city or state in the search box. Once they have entered a location, the latitude and longitude for this location are retrieved through geolocation. These values are then passed to Dark Sky Net to obtain the weather forecast for that place.

        <h3>Stock Charts</h3>

        <div class="description">
        This app currently displays the stock charts of three companies. The stock rates of these companies is being requested from Quandl. The charts have been generated by using C3.js which is a D3 based chart library. Users can click on the options shown at the bottom of the x-axis of the chart to display a specific category (high,low,open,close, average).
